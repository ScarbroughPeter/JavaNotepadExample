# Java Notepad Example

I practiced Java as a hobby for awhile and wanted to cap off what I had learned with a few simple projects. In this project, I worked to reproduce the basic windows notepad application in Java. This includes normal functionality - basic text writing, copying and pasting, saving and opening text files, amd setting font type and size.

I've included the relevant source code. The GUI was coded using the GUI tools in the NetBeans IDLE.

I've included relevant source files and the final distribution (.jar) file for the application. If Java is installed on one's machine they may simple download the jar file and run it like a regular application to test it for themselves.
